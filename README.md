Title: Predictive Modeling using Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning
1. Introduction
Machine learning models have become pivotal in solving complex classification problems across various domains. This project focuses on building a robust classification model using the Random Forest algorithm. The primary objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify target variables while handling missing data, optimizing performance through hyperparameter tuning, and rigorously evaluating the model using multiple metrics.

The dataset contains input features for both training and testing, as well as corresponding target variables. The project explores the steps required to preprocess data, handle missing values, train the model, and evaluate its performance on unseen test data.

2. Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Build a classification model using the Random Forest algorithm.
Handle missing values using advanced imputation techniques.
Optimize the model through hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and AUC score.
3. Data Description
The datasets used in this project include:

X_Train_Data_Input.csv: Training dataset with input features.
Y_Train_Data_Target.csv: Corresponding target values for the training set.
X_Test_Data_Input.csv: Test dataset with input features.
Y_Test_Data_Target.csv: Corresponding target values for the test set.
Each dataset contains several columns of numerical, categorical, and binary data. The target variable represents the class that the model is trained to predict.

4. Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach, including data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

4.1 Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for modeling, the following steps were performed:

Imputation of Missing Values:

Numerical Columns: Missing numerical values were imputed using Iterative Imputer (MICE). This technique imputes missing values through multivariate regression based on other features.
Binary Columns: For binary features, missing values were filled using the Simple Imputer, with the strategy set to 'most frequent'.
Feature Selection:

The features were categorized into numerical, categorical, and binary columns to apply the appropriate imputation techniques.
4.2 Modeling with Random Forest
A Random Forest Classifier was chosen for this classification task due to its high accuracy, ability to handle missing data, and resistance to overfitting. The model aggregates multiple decision trees, which helps reduce variance and improve performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: To enhance the model's performance, RandomizedSearchCV was used to perform hyperparameter tuning. Several hyperparameters, such as n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features, and bootstrap, were tested across multiple iterations to identify the best configuration for the model.
The best hyperparameters found during this search were applied to the final model.

4.3 Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated on both the training and test datasets. The following performance metrics were used:

Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted instances.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions.
Recall: The ability of the model to capture all actual positive instances.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the counts of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.
AUC and ROC Curve: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve were plotted to visualize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate at different thresholds.
5. Results and Discussion
Hyperparameter Tuning: The optimal hyperparameters found via RandomizedSearchCV were:

n_estimators: 300
max_depth: 20
min_samples_split: 5
min_samples_leaf: 2
max_features: 'sqrt'
bootstrap: True
Model Performance:

Accuracy on Training Data: The model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the training set.
Accuracy on Test Data: The accuracy on the test set was 97%, indicating strong generalization to unseen data.
Precision: 92%, showing the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases.
Recall: 90%, indicating the model effectively captures the majority of actual positives.
F1 Score: 91%, balancing precision and recall effectively.
Confusion Matrix:

AUC Score: 0.96, demonstrating excellent discriminative ability.
ROC Curve: The ROC curve showed a high true positive rate at lower false positive rates, confirming the model's reliability.
6. Conclusion
The Random Forest classifier, with optimized hyperparameters, performed effectively in predicting the target classes. The use of advanced imputation techniques for handling missing data ensured that the model made use of all available features. Hyperparameter tuning through RandomizedSearchCV significantly enhanced the model's performance.

The evaluation metrics, particularly the high AUC score and ROC curve, validated the model's strength in classifying the data. This project demonstrates the successful implementation of a machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to final model evaluation, highlighting the importance of tuning and evaluation in achieving high performance.
